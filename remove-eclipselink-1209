To remove **EclipseLink** as the persistence provider in your application or environment, you need to adjust configuration settings and dependencies accordingly. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

---

### **1. Update `persistence.xml`**
The `persistence.xml` file determines the JPA provider for your application. Locate and edit this file to remove EclipseLink as the provider.

- **Current configuration (with EclipseLink):**
  ```xml
  <provider>org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider</provider>
  ```

- **Updated configuration (replace with your desired provider):**
  For example, to use Hibernate:
  ```xml
  <provider>org.hibernate.jpa.HibernatePersistenceProvider</provider>
  ```

If no `provider` tag is specified, the application server may use its default provider.

---

### **2. Remove EclipseLink Dependencies**
Ensure that the EclipseLink libraries are no longer included in your application:

- **Maven Projects**: Remove EclipseLink from the `pom.xml`.
  ```xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.eclipse.persistence</groupId>
      <artifactId>eclipselink</artifactId>
      <version>2.x.x</version>
  </dependency>
  ```

- **Non-Maven Projects**: Delete the `eclipselink.jar` and any related JARs from the classpath (`WEB-INF/lib` or server-specific library folders).

---

### **3. Replace the JPA Provider Library**
If you’re switching to a new provider like Hibernate:

- Add the necessary library dependencies (e.g., `hibernate-core.jar` or its Maven equivalent).
- Ensure the new provider's library is correctly placed in the classpath or application package.

---

### **4. Check Application Server Settings**
In **WebSphere Application Server (WAS)**, EclipseLink might be registered globally or for a specific application. You need to update these settings:

1. **Log into the WAS Administrative Console**.
2. Navigate to **Resources > JPA Providers**.
3. Look for an entry associated with EclipseLink. If it exists:
   - Remove it or ensure it's no longer referenced by your application.
   - Register a new provider, if necessary.
4. Check your application's specific configuration under **Applications > [Your Application] > Class loader and JPA settings**.

---

### **5. Validate and Test**
After making the changes:
- Redeploy the application to ensure that EclipseLink is no longer being used.
- Monitor server logs for any indication that EclipseLink is loaded.
- Test database operations to verify the new provider works as expected.

---

### **6. Optional: Verify Server Default Provider**
If you do not specify a provider in the `persistence.xml`, the application server may default to its built-in provider. In WebSphere:
- Check the global settings to ensure the server's default provider is not EclipseLink.
- Update the default JPA provider in the administrative console if needed.

By following these steps, you can successfully remove EclipseLink as the persistence provider and transition to another JPA implementation.
