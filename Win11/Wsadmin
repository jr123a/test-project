This is a very common gotcha 👍 — nothing is wrong with your script.

You’re just running the command from the wrong directory / PATH.

⸻

Why this is happening

wsadmin (or wsadmin.bat) is not on the Windows PATH by default.

It lives inside your WebSphere installation, here:

C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\bin

So from C:\Users\QWPTGO> Windows simply cannot find it.

⸻

Fastest way to run it (recommended)

Option A: Run wsadmin using full path (one-time, safest)

From Command Prompt:

cd "C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\bin"

Then run:

wsadmin.bat -lang jython

You should now see the wsadmin> prompt.

To run your script:

wsadmin.bat -lang jython -f "C:\Workspace\Jython\create_j2c_from_csv.py" "C:\Workspace\Jython\J2CAliases-DEV.csv" dryrun

Then (after reviewing output):

wsadmin.bat -lang jython -f "C:\Workspace\Jython\create_j2c_from_csv.py" "C:\Workspace\Jython\J2CAliases-DEV.csv" apply


⸻

Even easier (zero typing errors)

Option B: Use the WebSphere Command Prompt shortcut

WebSphere installs a shortcut that pre-sets PATH and JAVA.
	1.	Start Menu
	2.	Search for “WebSphere”
	3.	Open “WebSphere Command Prompt” (or similar)

Then you can run directly:

wsadmin.bat -lang jython

or your script:

wsadmin.bat -lang jython -f "C:\Workspace\Jython\create_j2c_from_csv.py" "C:\Workspace\Jython\J2CAliases-DEV.csv" dryrun


⸻

Quick sanity check (important)

Before running the script, verify wsadmin is connecting to the correct profile:

At the wsadmin> prompt, run:

print AdminControl.getCell()

You should see something like:

EUCGroup00863Node02Cell

If that matches your Windows 11 WAS profile, you’re good.

⸻

Why I do NOT recommend adding wsadmin to PATH (for now)

You can add:

C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\bin

to PATH, but:
	•	Multiple WAS versions can conflict
	•	Easier to accidentally run against the wrong install later

For now, explicit path or WebSphere Command Prompt is safest.

⸻

Next step after this works

Once wsadmin launches successfully, your CSV-driven J2C script will run cleanly.
After that, we can:
	•	Script JDBC providers
	•	Script DataSources
	•	Script JMS / resource env entries
	•	Or export/import entire security config

You’re very close — this is just a PATH issue, not a WebSphere issue.
