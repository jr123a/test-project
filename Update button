Sure, here’s a concise and clear user story with acceptance criteria for adding the “Update” button functionality to persist the reordered API workflow list.

User Story: Add ‘Update’ Button to Persist API Workflow Order

Title: Add “Update” Button to Persist Reordered Workflow APIs

As a user of the application configuration UI,
I want the ability to save the updated sequence of selected workflow APIs after reordering them using “Move Up” and “Move Down”,
So that the new order is persisted and accurately reflected in the lower table as a comma-separated list under the “Workflow API Type Code” column.

⸻

Acceptance Criteria:
	1.	UI Element Present
	•	An “Update” button is displayed adjacent to the “Move Down” button.
	•	Button label is clearly identifiable as “Update”.
	2.	Persistence of Order
	•	When the “Update” button is clicked, the current order of selected APIs (as shown in the table above) is persisted.
	•	The persisted value is reflected as a comma-separated list in the lower table’s “Workflow API Type Code” column.
	3.	Order Accuracy
	•	The resulting string must represent the exact order of APIs as reordered by the user.
	•	No additional sorting is applied when saving.
	4.	Feedback/Confirmation (Optional)
	•	(Optional but recommended) A success message is displayed to the user confirming that the sequence was saved.
	5.	Session Consistency
	•	Navigating away and returning to the screen (if applicable) should show the saved order unless explicitly reset.

Let me know if you’d like this converted into a JIRA-style format or want to include edge case handling (e.g., empty list, duplicate entries).
