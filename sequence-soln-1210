If you need to create a sequence that continues from the last value in a specific column or table, follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Find the Last Value**
   Run a query to find the maximum value from the relevant column or table:
   ```sql
   SELECT MAX(your_column) AS last_value FROM your_table;
   ```
   - Replace `your_column` with the name of the column where the sequence values are stored.
   - Replace `your_table` with the table name.

   Example result:
   ```
   LAST_VALUE
   ----------
   125
   ```

---

### 2. **Create the Sequence Starting from the Last Value**
   Use the retrieved `LAST_VALUE` as the starting point for the sequence. For example, if the last value is `125`, create the sequence like this:
   ```sql
   CREATE SEQUENCE SEQ_GEN_IDENTITY
       START WITH 126  -- Start from the next value
       INCREMENT BY 1  -- Increment by 1 for each call
       NOCACHE  -- Optional: Avoid caching sequence values
       NOCYCLE;  -- Optional: Prevent the sequence from restarting
   ```

---

### 3. **Verify the Sequence**
   After creating the sequence, test it to ensure it generates the correct values:
   ```sql
   SELECT SEQ_GEN_IDENTITY.NEXTVAL FROM DUAL;
   ```

   - The result should be `126`, `127`, and so on.

---

### 4. **Reassign Existing Records (Optional)**
   If there are records with missing or invalid IDs in your table, you may need to update them using the sequence:
   ```sql
   UPDATE your_table
   SET your_column = SEQ_GEN_IDENTITY.NEXTVAL
   WHERE your_column IS NULL;
   ```

---

### 5. **Grant Permissions (If Required)**
   If your application uses a different database user, ensure it has access to the sequence:
   ```sql
   GRANT SELECT ON SEQ_GEN_IDENTITY TO APPLICATION_USER;
   ```

Would you like help with the exact SQL based on your table and column names?
