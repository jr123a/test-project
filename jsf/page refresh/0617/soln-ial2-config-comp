Here‚Äôs what I found in your `ial2_configuration.xhtml` file:

### ‚úÖ Working `<a4j:ajax>` Tag (From `ial2_configuration.xhtml`)

```xhtml
<a4j:ajax 
    event="valueChange" 
    listener="#{bean.loadFormControls}" 
    render="idStrongIdTypePnl idFairIdTypePnl idControlPnl idButtonPnl idFormMessagePnl" />
```

This tag is:

* Attached to a dropdown (likely a `<h:selectOneMenu>`)
* Using **no `execute` attribute** (defaults to `@this`)
* **Rendering multiple panels by ID**, all likely inside the same `<h:form>`

### üîç Key Differences Compared to `sponsor_emails.xhtml`

| Aspect                 | `ial2_configuration.xhtml`                   | `sponsor_emails.xhtml`                                                   |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `execute`              | ‚ùå Not present (defaults to `@this`)          | ‚úÖ Present, but was set to `@component` (bad) or later changed to `@this` |
| `form layout`          | Likely simpler, flat form                    | More complex nested layout (uses template)                               |
| Panel `rendered` flags | Unknown, likely **always visible**           | ‚úÖ Uses `rendered="#{bean.*Visible}"` ‚Äî requires AJAX to preserve bean    |
| ViewScope behavior     | Works correctly                              | Fails on second AJAX, `selectedSponsor` is lost                          |
| Bean usage             | Likely **same `@ManagedBean`/`@ViewScoped`** | ‚úÖ Same                                                                   |

### üí° What This Tells Us

* Your `ial2_configuration.xhtml` works **because the bean is preserved**, ViewState is intact, and panels don‚Äôt rely on dynamic `rendered=` flags that get skipped when the bean resets.
* Your `sponsor_emails.xhtml` fails after first AJAX because:

  1. **`selectedSponsor` is not getting submitted on future requests** (confirmed from HAR).
  2. **The bean is reset or partially constructed**, so `editorPanelVisible` and others default to `false`.
  3. RichFaces‚Äô internal state or JSF 2.2 behavior is stricter in WAS 9, especially with partial views.

---

### ‚úÖ What You Can Try (Inspired by `ial2_configuration.xhtml` Success)

1. **Temporarily remove `rendered="#{bean.*Visible}"`** from the panels to test if it‚Äôs purely a visibility flag issue.
2. **Match AJAX tag structure exactly**:

   ```xhtml
   <a4j:ajax 
       event="valueChange" 
       listener="#{bean.selectSponsor}" 
       render="editorPanel brandLogoPanel sendEmailPanel" />
   ```

   Do **not** use `execute` unless necessary.
3. Wrap each panel with a dummy component (like `h:panelGroup layout="block"`) and confirm they‚Äôre inside the same form.

Would you like me to show you a test case where both working and broken versions are laid out side by side for visual comparison?
