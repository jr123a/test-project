Thanks for sharing your `web.xml`. After thoroughly reviewing it, here's the **root issue**:

---

## ðŸ”´ Root Cause

Your `web.xml` is **missing** the required `org.ajax4jsf.Filter` (aka **RichFaces filter**), which is **mandatory** for `rich:fileUpload` to parse multipart/form-data properly.

Without this filter:

* The multipart request is never intercepted and decoded by RichFaces.
* The file data is not processed and the **"Request prolog cannot be read"** error is triggered by `MultipartRequestParser`.

---

## âœ… Solution: Add the RichFaces Filter

Add this block **near the other filters** in `web.xml`:

```xml
<filter>
  <filter-name>richfaces</filter-name>
  <filter-class>org.ajax4jsf.Filter</filter-class>
</filter>

<filter-mapping>
  <filter-name>richfaces</filter-name>
  <servlet-name>Faces Servlet</servlet-name>
  <dispatcher>REQUEST</dispatcher>
  <dispatcher>FORWARD</dispatcher>
  <dispatcher>INCLUDE</dispatcher>
</filter-mapping>
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ Additional Recommendations

1. **Place this above** your `Faces Servlet` mapping to ensure it runs first.
2. Make sure you're using `<h:form enctype="multipart/form-data">` in your XHTML (as you already are).
3. You can leave your `rich:fileUpload` settings unchanged if this filter is added.

---

## âœ… Why This Works

RichFaces' `FileUpload` relies on this `Filter` to:

* Parse the multipart boundary
* Make uploaded files available in the JSF lifecycle
* Prevent raw access to the input stream (which is what triggers your current exception)

---

## ðŸ§ª Test After Adding

After updating `web.xml`, **restart the server**, then:

* Try uploading a file in **both your isolated upload page** and
* The **full `sponsor_emails.xhtml` page**

It should now pass through without triggering `MultipartRequestParser.readProlog` errors.

Would you like me to generate a fully patched version of your `web.xml` with the RichFaces filter inserted correctly?
