This is a significant finding. Here's what the comparison reveals:

### üîç `javax.faces.partial.execute` Analysis

| Environment | `javax.faces.partial.execute`                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **WAS 8.5** | `@component idSelSponsor`, `@component idSelEmail` |
| **WAS 9**   | Only `@component` (no component ID) ‚ùå              |

---

### üß® Root Problem Identified

In **WAS 9**, the AJAX request is missing the actual component ID to execute (i.e., process during JSF lifecycle). The value is just `@component`, which is **ambiguous** or **invalid in some JSF implementations** (especially stricter ones like Mojarra in WAS 9).

JSF expects something like:

```
javax.faces.partial.execute=idSelSponsor
```

or

```
javax.faces.partial.execute=@this
```

But `@component` **doesn‚Äôt resolve properly unless explicitly understood by the implementation** ‚Äî this could be the cause of:

* **`selectedSponsor` not being updated**
* **Managed bean not getting values**
* **Subsequent AJAX calls failing silently**

---

### ‚úÖ What to Fix

In your `sponsor_emails.xhtml`, inside `<a4j:ajax>`, change:

```xhtml
<a4j:ajax event="valueChange"
          listener="#{bean.selectSponsor}"
          render="editorPanel,..."
          execute="@component" />
```

to:

```xhtml
<a4j:ajax event="valueChange"
          listener="#{bean.selectSponsor}"
          render="editorPanel,..."
          execute="@this" />
```

Or even better, **explicitly reference** the dropdown ID:

```xhtml
<a4j:ajax event="valueChange"
          listener="#{bean.selectSponsor}"
          render="editorPanel,..."
          execute="idSelSponsor" />
```

Do this for **both sponsor and email dropdowns**.

### ‚úÖ Summary

* `@component` is breaking in WAS9 ‚Äî it's too vague or deprecated.
* Use `@this` or the actual ID like `idSelSponsor` in `execute` attributes.
* This aligns the WAS 9 behavior with what already works in WAS 8.5.
