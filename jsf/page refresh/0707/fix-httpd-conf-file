Thank you ‚Äî no need to resend it. Based on the `httpd.conf` you previously uploaded and your latest update (i.e., **you don't have access to `plugin-cfg.xml`**, and you need to fix this from the **IBM HTTP Server `httpd.conf` side**), I‚Äôve crafted a targeted and production-safe patch for your **IHS config file**.

---

## ‚úÖ Goal

Allow the RichFaces and JSF resources (like `contents.css`, `/skins/...`, `/plugins/...`) to **pass through IHS without throwing 404**, especially in SIT behind a load balancer.

---

## ‚úÖ What You Need to Add to `httpd.conf`

Add this block **at the bottom of your `httpd.conf`**, above the `<VirtualHost>` if possible:

```apache
# ======== START: USPS IVSAdmin Static Resource Fix ========
<Directory "/opt/WebSphere/IBMIHS9/htdocs">
    # Allow access to these paths to be passed through to WebSphere
    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
        RewriteEngine On

        # Allow JSF/RichFaces static resources to go to WebSphere
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/IVSAdmin/(javax\.faces\.resource|org\.richfaces\.resources|skins|plugins|contents\.css)
        RewriteRule ^/IVSAdmin/(.*)$ /$1 [PT,L]
    </IfModule>
</Directory>
# ========= END: USPS IVSAdmin Static Resource Fix =========
```

---

## ‚úÖ What This Does

* **Intercepts only `/IVSAdmin/...` requests** that match:

  * `/javax.faces.resource/`
  * `/org.richfaces.resources/`
  * `/skins/`
  * `/plugins/`
  * `contents.css`
* **Passes them to WebSphere** instead of making IHS look for them on disk
* Uses `[PT,L]` (Pass Through + Last Rule) to cooperate with WebSphere plugin

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Notes

1. Put the block near the bottom of `httpd.conf` ‚Äî ideally **after `DocumentRoot` and before `<VirtualHost>`**.
2. Save file, ensure permissions are retained.
3. **Restart IBM HTTP Server**:

   ```bash
   apachectl stop
   apachectl start
   ```

---

## ‚úÖ Bonus Debug Tip (Optional)

If you want to verify it‚Äôs hitting the rewrite rule, add this above the block:

```apache
RewriteLogLevel 3
RewriteLog /opt/WebSphere/IBMIHS9/logs/rewrite.log
```

Make sure `/opt/WebSphere/IBMIHS9/logs/` is writable by the IHS process.

---

## Final Step

Once deployed:

* Visit the page again through SIT load balancer
* Confirm Rich Text Editor loads fully
* Check `contents.css` no longer throws 404

Would you like a before/after diff version of `httpd.conf` for easier change tracking or just the final full copy ready to send?
