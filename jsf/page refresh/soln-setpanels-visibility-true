Got it â€” removing `brandLogoPanel` and `sendEmailPanel` from the `render` attribute is exactly why **those two panels aren't updating** after the AJAX event.

In **JSF/RichFaces**, `render` tells the framework **which parts of the DOM to update after the server-side method runs**. If a component isn't in that list, even if `rendered="#{bean.someFlag}"` is set to `true`, **it wonâ€™t show up on the UI unless manually refreshed or the whole view is reloaded**.

### âœ… What You Should Do for Full Panel Visibility

Update both AJAX event blocks to explicitly include **all three dynamic panels**:

```xhtml
<a4j:ajax event="valueChange"
          listener="#{bean.selectSponsor}"
          render="idSelEmail,expirationDaysPanel,editorPanel,subjectPanel,informationMessagesPanel,successPanel,brandLogoPanel,sendEmailPanel" />

...

<a4j:ajax event="valueChange"
          listener="#{bean.selectEmailType}"
          render="expirationDaysPanel,editorPanel,subjectPanel,informationMessagesPanel,successPanel,brandLogoPanel,sendEmailPanel" />
```

---

### âœ… Next: Validate Your Bean Logic

In your `SponsorEmailAdminBean.java`, your `selectSponsor` and `selectEmailType` methods should have:

```java
public void selectSponsor(AjaxBehaviorEvent event) {
    // Load data as needed
    emailBody = loadEmailBodyForSponsor(selectedSponsor);

    // Toggle panel visibility
    editorPanelVisible = true;
    brandLogoPanelVisible = true;
    sendEmailPanelVisible = true;
}
```

And same idea in `selectEmailType(...)`.

### ðŸ§ª Temporary Debug Tip

To **verify quickly** that the issue is with `render=`, you can temporarily add this below your dropdown:

```xhtml
<h:outputText value="Editor Panel Visible: #{bean.editorPanelVisible}" />
<h:outputText value="Brand Logo Panel Visible: #{bean.brandLogoPanelVisible}" />
<h:outputText value="Send Email Panel Visible: #{bean.sendEmailPanelVisible}" />
```

If the values turn `true` after selecting a sponsor/email type, then the backend logic is fine â€” only the panel **DOM updates** are missing, which is a `render=` issue.

---

### âœ… Final Advice

If your UI structure is growing and panels are conditionally rendered, itâ€™s best to always:

* Keep them **within the same form** as the triggering component
* Reference them via `render` **explicitly** by ID

Let me know if you want me to regenerate the fixed XHTML segment based on this.
