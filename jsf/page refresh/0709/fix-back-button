Great question ‚Äî and yes, this behavior **is expected** when using `h:inputFile` (standard JSF file upload) with `enctype="multipart/form-data"` on the form. Here's why you're seeing that navigation (`action="sponsor_emails?faces-redirect=true"`) stop working:

### üîç Root Cause

When a form is submitted with `enctype="multipart/form-data"`, **standard JSF navigation (`action="page?faces-redirect=true"`) often gets bypassed or broken**, depending on how the servlet handles the request.

JSF processes navigation **based on the view state**, but with multipart forms:

* JSF lifecycle has to **manually parse** the multipart content (usually via `Servlet 3.0 Part` APIs).
* If your `@ManagedBean` action method is called and still returns the correct outcome (e.g., `sponsor_emails?faces-redirect=true`), but **navigation doesn‚Äôt occur**, the likely cause is:

  * **View state lost**
  * **Faces redirect logic skipped**
  * Or **you‚Äôre not returning a valid navigation outcome** (due to the multipart nature).

### ‚úÖ Solution Options

#### ‚úÖ 1. Use `ExternalContext.redirect()` in the bean

This is the **most reliable way** to force a redirect after a multipart form submission.

In your `SponsorEmailsAdminBean` (or whatever backing bean you're using):

```java
public void goBackToSponsorEmails() {
    try {
        FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getExternalContext().redirect("sponsor_emails.xhtml");
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace(); // or better error handling
    }
}
```

And in XHTML:

```xhtml
<h:commandButton value="Back to Email Configs" action="#{bean.goBackToSponsorEmails}" />
```

---

#### ‚úÖ 2. Use a **JavaScript redirect** as a workaround (not recommended for critical logic)

If you want to avoid Java method, you can do something like:

```xhtml
<h:commandButton value="Back to Email Configs" onclick="window.location.href='sponsor_emails.xhtml'; return false;" />
```

But this **does not go through JSF lifecycle** and won‚Äôt work if you need any server-side processing.

---

#### ‚úÖ 3. Use `<h:button>` (Not applicable in multipart forms)

You **cannot** use `<h:button>` inside a `multipart/form-data` form if the goal is to submit anything ‚Äî it creates an HTML button but **does not submit the form data** in a usable way.

---

### üß† Summary

When using `<h:inputFile>` with `enctype="multipart/form-data"`:

* **JSF navigation via outcome string often fails silently**
* You must **explicitly redirect** using `ExternalContext.redirect(...)` in the backing bean

Let me know if you want me to give you a final working snippet that does the redirect cleanly from within your upload form.
