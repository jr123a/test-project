Based on the logs provided, the following observations and possible reasons can explain why the entity might not be saved to the database:

### Observations:
1. **Transaction Management:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of `PROPAGATION_REQUIRED` and transactions being created and joined (`join=true`). 
   - However, there is no indication that the transaction is committed after persisting the entity.

2. **EntityManager Usage:**
   - The log `Cannot access EntityTransaction handle - assuming we're in a JTA environment` confirms this is a JTA-based transaction management setup.
   - The EntityManager is being opened, but there is no log explicitly indicating that the `persist` or `merge` operation has been called for your entity.

3. **No Errors or Exceptions:**
   - The absence of exceptions suggests that the persistence code is not failing but might not be executing as intended or completing the save operation.

4. **Service Methods:**
   - The `assessDevicePlusEmailRisk` and related methods (`buildCheckDevicePlusValidationResponse`, `mergeParamObjects`, etc.) are logged, but there is no clear evidence that the method responsible for persisting the entity is being invoked.

---

### Possible Reasons for the Entity Not Being Saved:
1. **Missing `persist` or `save` Call:**
   - The entity may not be explicitly persisted within the transaction. Ensure that `EntityManager.persist()` or `JpaRepository.save()` is being called for the entity.

2. **No Transaction Commit:**
   - JTA-managed transactions require explicit commitment. If the transaction is not committed (e.g., because of a method returning prematurely or missing `@Transactional`), the changes won't be flushed to the database.

3. **Detached Entity:**
   - If the entity is not managed (e.g., not attached to the persistence context), changes might not propagate to the database. Ensure the entity is attached to the persistence context before modification.

4. **Read-Only Transaction:**
   - If the transaction is marked as read-only, database changes will not be persisted. Check the configuration of the transaction propagation settings.

5. **Entity Validation or Constraints:**
   - Silent validation failures or constraint violations could prevent the entity from being persisted. For example, if an `@NotNull` or unique constraint fails, the entity may not save without raising a runtime error.

6. **Improper Propagation:**
   - The use of `PROPAGATION_REQUIRED` in conjunction with `join=true` means existing transactions are being reused. If the calling transaction is rolled back or incomplete, no data will be saved.

### Suggestions to Debug and Resolve:
1. **Verify `persist` or `save` is Called:**
   - Add debug logs around the code responsible for persisting the entity:
     ```java
     log.debug("Persisting entity: " + entity);
     entityManager.persist(entity);
     log.debug("Entity persisted: " + entity);
     ```

2. **Ensure Transaction is Committed:**
   - Confirm that the transaction is successfully committed by the framework. Use logs or debugging tools to monitor transaction completion.

3. **Check `@Transactional` Annotation:**
   - Ensure that the service method responsible for persisting the entity is annotated with `@Transactional`.

     Example:
     ```java
     @Transactional
     public void saveEntity(YourEntity entity) {
         entityManager.persist(entity);
     }
     ```

4. **Enable SQL Logging:**
   - Enable Hibernate SQL logging to confirm if an `INSERT` statement is generated for the entity:
     ```properties
     spring.jpa.show-sql=true
     spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true
     ```

5. **Inspect Entity State:**
   - Check if the entity is managed or detached before the persist/save call:
     ```java
     log.debug("Entity is managed: " + entityManager.contains(entity));
     ```

6. **Validate Transactional Flow:**
   - Review the full call stack and ensure the transactional boundaries are respected.

7. **Unit Test Persistence Logic:**
   - Write an isolated unit test to verify that the entity persists successfully outside of the application flow.

By systematically addressing these points, you should be able to pinpoint the reason the entity is not getting saved. Let me know if you can provide the actual code for the service or repository layer; I can provide a more targeted analysis.
