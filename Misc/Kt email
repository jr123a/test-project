Hi Michelle,

The knowledge-transfer sessions with Emer were held from September through the first week of October. I had scheduled them as a recurring series for a month, with the option to extend as needed. After completing the intended knowledge transfer during the fourth session, Emer mentioned that regular meetings were no longer necessary. I’ve since been working on the security-related items we discussed.

Best regards,
Jagan
