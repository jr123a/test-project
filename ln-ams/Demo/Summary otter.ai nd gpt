Here’s a structured breakdown of the LN AMS demo from MR, tying it together with the sample request style you shared from the screenshots and the RemoteRest.json collection:

⸻

1. High-Level Summary
	•	The demo showed how LN AMS (LexisNexis Address Management System) integrates into the USPS identity proofing workflow.
	•	Two levels of checks:
	•	Level 1: Device + Email Risk Assessment.
	•	Level 2: Business Address + ID checks through AMS.
	•	The workflow can branch depending on pass/fail results, and a passive mode option allows cascading checks regardless of AMS results.
	•	Leadership decision: currently AMS is bypassed in production (only checks residential vs business), but framework is in place for future use.

⸻

2. Workflow Steps

Step 1: Device & Email Risk (Level 1)
	•	Endpoint: CheckDevice (from RemoteRest.json) ￼
	•	Request includes:
	•	sponsorCode, customerUniqueID, firstName, lastName, emailAddress,
	•	Address details, phone, session IDs, and IP.
	•	Outcomes:
	•	If fail (e.g., invalid email), workflow stops.
	•	If pass, continue to Level 2.

⸻

Step 2: AMS Checks (Level 2)
	•	Verifies business identity using:
	•	companyName + address.
	•	Outcomes:
	•	If AMS fails, proceed to BID (Business ID) Check or ID verification.
	•	If AMS passes, normally workflow ends here unless passive mode is enabled.

⸻

Step 3: Passive Mode
	•	Configurable flag: amsPassiveMode = true.
	•	Behavior:
	•	Even if AMS passes, still proceed to BID/ID check.
	•	Used to make flow more restrictive (i.e., AMS + BID both must pass).
	•	This was demoed in Postman by toggling configuration in SponsorConfiguration.

⸻

Step 4: Final Decision
	•	Possible outcomes:
	•	Fail at Level 1 → Workflow stops.
	•	Pass Level 1, Fail Level 2 → Final = Fail.
	•	Pass Level 1, Pass Level 2 → Final = Pass.
	•	Passive Mode ON → BID check still called, outcome depends on both AMS + BID.

3. Sample Request (from your screenshots & RemoteRest.json)

Example payload to CheckDevice (/RemoteRest/resources/remote/CheckDevice):

{
  "sponsorCode": "coa",
  "customerUniqueID": "2023051704",
  "firstName": "Emer",
  "lastName": "Credo",
  "emailAddress": "medium_confidence@usps.gov",
  "streetAddress1": "42981 Bonnieblue Ct",
  "city": "Ashburn",
  "state": "VA",
  "zipCode": "20147",
  "mobilePhone": "5711234567",
  "profilingSessionID": "8236EA586816-19c77d19-e778-442c-bcfa",
  "webSessionID": "rDDJL5AUy2eTmXjm3L_sb-Z",
  "trueIPAddress": "127.0.0.1"
}

	•	This triggers Level 1 (Device + Email Risk).
	•	If successful, the same company/address data is reused for Level 2 AMS checks.

⸻

4. Key Takeaways
	•	AMS is currently limited but kept in workflow for future expansion.
	•	Passive Mode ensures BID check always runs, even if AMS passes.
	•	The system is designed for flexibility: USPS can tighten or relax rules by changing configurations.
	•	In production, AMS is bypassed due to limited fraud prevention capability, but integration framework is complete.

Would you like me to draw a simple flow diagram (showing Level 1 → Level 2 → Passive Mode branch → Final decision) so it’s easier to visualize the workflow?
