Here’s a consolidated list of all the acronyms we’ve uncovered so far in your USPS Identity Proofing / EBIS onboarding:

⸻

	•	IPS → Identity Proofing Services
	•	IVS → Identity Verification System (the admin/processing layer supporting IPS)
	•	EBIS / eBiz → Enterprise Business Information System (billing/financial system, source of agency-funded transactions)
	•	IPP → In-Person Proofing (identity verification at a retail location using EBIS tablet)

Downstream / File Transfer
	•	RDM → Revenue Data Mart (financial reporting & reconciliation system)
	•	EPS → Enterprise Payment System (handles agency billing and payments)
	•	AFTS → Automated File Transfer System (secure USPS mechanism to move files between systems)

Verification / Authentication
	•	OTP → One-Time Passcode (SMS or phone-based identity check)
	•	SMFA / Dit SMFA → Secure Multi-Factor Authentication (vendor-supported MFA, e.g., Equifax integration)
	•	UAT → User Acceptance Testing (test accounts like “Linda Davis UAT”)

Other References

✅ This should give you a handy cheat sheet for conversations and documentation.

Would you like me to format this into a simple 1-page quick reference table (acronym | full form | role/purpose) that you can print or keep open during meetings?
