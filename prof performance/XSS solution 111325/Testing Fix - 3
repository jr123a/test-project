Absolutely — you can safely demonstrate to your team that your new filter blocks <script>-style XSS attacks inside IPSWeb itself, without actually attacking the app, and without writing malicious payloads.

I’ll show you exactly how to simulate the flow, using only CAT / DEV, only harmless test strings, and only URLs your own app generates.
This is the correct and safe way to demonstrate the filter works.

⸻

✅ What you want to prove

When IPSWeb receives a request where the query string contains script-like characters or patterns (<script>, alert(1), javascript:), the filter blocks the request before it reaches the Faces servlet.

Your new filter already does that, so you just need a clean demonstration.

⸻

✅ What environment to use

CAT or local WebSphere only.
NEVER test this in production.

🧪 DEMO STEP-BY-STEP — Three safe flows to show the team

Below are the three demonstrations you should perform in front of your team (or record them). These show conclusively that the filter stops XSS.

⸻

DEMO 1: Use a harmless “script-like” value

This proves the filter triggers on < or > or script.

Step 1 — Open IPSWeb CAT

Example:

https://ips-cat.usps.com/IPSWeb/verification_user_information.xhtml

Step 2 — Append a harmless “fake XSS” to the URL

Copy/paste this:

?test=<script>

Or the encoded version (even safer):

?test=%3Cscript%3E

Step 3 — Hit Enter

You should immediately see:
	•	HTTP 500 java.lang.SecurityException: Potential XSS attack detected.
	•	A WebSphere stack trace showing your filter class
	•	Your log entry:

Potential XSS attack in param 'test': <script>



Step 4 — Show DevTools Network

Your filter will be visible as:
	•	500 response
	•	your log warning
	•	no Faces/JSF processing

⸻

DEMO 2 — Use a “script keyword” without < or >

This proves your keyword detection works, not just angle-bracket detection.

Test URL:

?cmd=alert(1)

Expected result:
	•	Filter blocks the request
	•	Log shows:

Potential XSS attack in param 'cmd': alert(1)


	•	Response: SecurityException
	•	The page does not load the Faces view

This demonstrates keyword detection (alert(, script, javascript:) works even without HTML tags.

⸻

DEMO 3 — Use a safe request to show normal flow

To show your filter isn’t breaking real traffic.

Step 1 — Open normal IPSWeb flow

Example:

https://ips-cat.usps.com/IPSWeb/verification_user_information.xhtml?do=start

Step 2 — Enter a phone number and continue

Expected:
	•	Form posts successfully
	•	No SecurityExceptions
	•	Logs show no XSS warnings
	•	Page advances to passcode step

This shows that your filter only blocks malicious patterns — not legitimate traffic.

⸻

🧪 HOW TO CAPTURE THE PROOF FOR THE TEAM

During each test:

1. Open DevTools → Network → Preserve log

This shows:
	•	the request URL
	•	response code 500
	•	the timing
	•	the filter blocking the request before JSF executes

2. Open SystemOut.log in WebSphere CAT server

You will see:

WARN - com.ips.servlet.filter.IPSCustRegSessionFilter-> Potential XSS attack in param 'xxx': ...
java.lang.SecurityException: Potential XSS attack detected.

3. Capture a short screen recording

This is the easiest way to demo it to management and QA.

⸻

📌 OPTIONAL: A safer “dummy XSS string” for demos

If you want something that looks like an XSS attack but is totally harmless:

<script test="xss_demo"></script>

Encoded form (prefer this):

%3Cscript%20test%3Dxss_demo%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E

These will trigger your filter but never execute anything.

⸻

🧠 WHY THIS IS SAFE
	•	The filter blocks before JSF renders anything
	•	No JS is executed
	•	No data is altered
	•	You’re in CAT / DEV only
	•	You’re using harmless test strings, not exploit payloads

This is exactly how security teams validate filters.

⸻

🎯 TL;DR — Recommended demo sequence to your team

Use these URLs in CAT:

1️⃣ ...?test=%3Cscript%3E → BLOCKED
2️⃣ ...?cmd=alert(1) → BLOCKED
3️⃣ Normal flow → ALLOWED

All validated with DevTools + WebSphere logs.

⸻

If you want, I can prepare a one-page demo script you can email to your manager/Katia/QA showing exactly how to verify the filter in CAT.
