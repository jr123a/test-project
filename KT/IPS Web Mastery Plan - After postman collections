I was able to fully open both uploaded **Postman collections** (Remote and IPP) and cross-map them with your KTE transcripts. Here‚Äôs the updated mastery plan I recommend (I‚Äôve already folded the essentials into your Canvas doc, but here‚Äôs the key update summary for you):

---

### üîë Remote Proofing (RemoteRest.json)

* **Sponsor Configurations**: Requests like `CreateRefSponsorConfigurationRecords` let you seed sponsors (e.g., Operation Santa, COA). This maps exactly to the transcript where you change `sponsorCode` (`COA`, `OS`, `CR`).
* **Step Flow in Collection**:

  1. `CheckDevice` (medium/low/high confidence variations using test users like *Linda Davis UAT*, *Emer Credo*, *Testuser Phonepass*).
  2. `VerifyPhone`.
  3. `RequestPasscode` ‚Üí `ConfirmPasscode` (use `1111` for Experian in SIT; Equifax returns mobile link).
  4. `ValidateLink` if Equifax scenario.
  5. Status check (some collections label this as ‚Äúfinalize‚Äù).
* **Variables**: `{{local-ips}}`, `{{jagan-cell}}`, sponsor codes, profilingSessionID/webSessionID (refresh these for each run).
* **Transcript Alignment**: Matches exactly with \[96‚Ä†IPSWeb-tests-cases-kt-transcript-1] and \[95‚Ä†IPSWeb-tests-cases-kt-transcript-2] where you were walked through COA/OS sponsors and test data like medium\_confidence emails.

### üè¢ In-Person Proofing (IPP Performance.postman\_collection.json)

* **Flow** (straight from collection and transcript hints):

  1. `generateBarcode` (kickoff a session).
  2. `lookupVisit` (use CustomerUniqueID).
  3. `submitIDCapture` (driver‚Äôs license/passport data stubbed).
  4. `postResult` (send verification outcome).
  5. `status` poll.
* **Variables**: `{{ippBaseUrl}}`, sponsor/vendor, CUID, test user attributes.
* **Hands-On Goal**: Align this with the KTE‚Äôs emphasis on not just remote but also IPP hands-on, so you know how the flows differ (device checks/OTP vs. physical ID scan submission).

### üéØ Next Actions for You

1. **Parameterize** your Postman environment: set `local-ips`, `ippBaseUrl`, `jagan-cell`, sponsor codes.
2. **Practice both flows**: run RemoteRest medium\_confidence ‚Üí OTP, then IPP barcode ‚Üí ID capture.
3. **Vendor-specific mastery**: simulate Equifax link validation vs. Experian `1111` passcode.
4. **Compare DB persistence**: after runs, verify IPS Web middle table pre-populates with DB values (your earlier question).
5. **Build Newman scripts**: export both runs as JSON evidence packs.

Would you like me to **expand your Canvas doc** to include **side-by-side remote vs. in-person flow diagrams** (with callout boxes showing Postman request names)? That would make it visually easy to internalize the difference between the two proofing modes.
