# 📄 Equifax Remote Proofing Runbook

## ✅ Step-by-Step Test Flow

☑ **Start with Device Reputation (CheckDevice)**

* Triggered after “Continue” (Hold Mail) or page load (Informed Delivery).
* Outcomes:

  * **Pass** → Flow ends, user approved.
  * **Reject** → Flow ends, user denied.
  * **Review** → Only case that continues → Equifax SMFA.

☑ **If Review → Run Equifax Link/SMFA**

* Click **Send Link**, tap it on phone.
* Page polls until Equifax returns decision.
* Retry logic removed — only one poll cycle.

☑ **Observe Phone Result (SMFA)**

* Requires **whitelisted phone number** with Equifax.
* Outcomes:

  * **Green/Yellow** → Success
  * **Red/Orange** → Fail

☑ **Check DB for Trust Factors**

* Raw payload logged.
* Parsed into trust columns:

  * `identity_trust`
  * `address_trust`
  * `phone_trust`
* Final decision stored (`APPROVE / REVIEW / DENY`).

☑ **Cross-check Decision Map**

* Decision determined by trust permutations.
* All “Y” = APPROVE.
* Identity N = DENY.
* Mixed = REVIEW.
